# Chat history in Kaizala

[!INCLUDE [retirement-note](includes/retirement-note.md)]

Have you ever felt that you wanted your group members to view messages that were sent before they joined? Kaizala now lets you do that.

Chat History feature in Kaizala enables Group Admins to let older messages be visible to new group members. New members can also like, comment or respond to previously sent Kaizala Actions such as announcements, polls, surveys, training, etc. that were shared before they joined the group.

## Enable group chat history

Group admins can enable chat history both from the Kaizala management portal and the Kaizala app.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, chat history is enabled for all groups in Kaizala.

> [!NOTE]
> Only messages sent after enabling this policy will be visible to new users.

### Enable chat history using the Kaizala app

1. Open the Kaizala app.
2. Tap the group for which you want chat history to be enabled.
3. Tap the group name on the top bar. The group information will open.
4. Tap **More** ![Screenshot of More icon.](media/more-icon.png) on top-right of the window. Tap **Enable chat history**.
5. In the dialog pop-up window, tap **Enable**.

### Enable chat history using the Kaizala management portal

1. Log in to the [Kaizala management portal](https://manage.kaiza.la) using your Office 365 school or work account.
2. Select the **Groups** tab on the left.
3. Select the group from the group list for which you want chat history to be enabled.
4. Select **More** ![Screenshot of More icon.](media/more-icon.png) next to the group name.
5. Select **Edit Policies**. The **Group Policy** dialog box opens.
6. Select the check box for chat history.
7. Select **Save**.

For private groups, messages are saved only for a maximum period of 45 days. For organizational groups, messages are saved for an unlimited period of time. In 1-1 chats, chat history cannot be enabled. 

## User experience

If the chat history feature is turned on for a group, chats start getting saved in Kaizala. This enables new group members to view saved messages that were sent even when they hadn't joined the group.

When a new user joins a group that has chat history enabled, the user can view 10 older messages by default. If a user wants to view more older messages, the user needs to scroll up at the top of the chat canvas to load more messages. Currently every time a user scrolls at the top of the chat canvas, 20 more old messages are downloaded for view.

## Disable group chat history

Group admins can disable chat history both from the Kaizala management portal and the Kaizala app.

> [!NOTE]
> Once chat history is disabled, it stops showing older messages to new users.
