# Get work done with Kaizala Actions

[!INCLUDE [retirement-note](includes/retirement-note.md)]

Kaizala offers a wide range of action cards or mini apps that make your daily work management easy and efficient. You can use the out-of-the-box Action cards or create your own customized Kaizala Actions. Let’s get you started with some of the Kaizala Actions such as survey, attendance, and job that can help you get work done.

2. Select the **Survey** option, and enter the relevant details such as title.
3. Use the **Add a question** button to enter questions on the form.

   Finally, pick your survey options. You can decide when the survey will expire and whether you want to make answers visible to others.

4. Once you’re done setting up the questions, share the survey with the group. Admins can track how many people have answered the feedback by selecting the survey card in the chat window.

5. You can use the Survey Action card for several scenarios where data from remote workers needs to be collected. Some examples are collecting sales data from agents, conducting remote audits, and checking on faraway operations. 
6. Detailed reporting on all surveys sent out to your employees, suppliers, and partners can be viewed on the Kaizala management portal under **Analytics** > **Surveys**.
