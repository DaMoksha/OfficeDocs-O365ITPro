# Create Kaizala users

[!INCLUDE [retirement-note](includes/retirement-note.md)]

Before you can send instant messages, pictures, and documents, or set up a new poll or survey, you'll have to create Kaizala users. You can add users individually or in bulk. For managing users in groups, see [Kaizala groups](groups-in-kaizala.md).
  
## View all users in an organization

On the Kaizala management portal, from the left navigation pane, choose **Directory**. You'll see a list of all users who have access to your organization. This includes users who were uploaded directly through the **Import Multiple Users** process, along with the members of organization groups mapped to your organization. 
    
You can also show up to four columns of information about users by choosing **More** ![Screenshot of More icon.](media/more-icon.png) \> **Select Columns**.

Kaizala organization admins can define and manage user attributes for an organization. They can add custom user attributes (for example, employee ID or manager) in the Kaizala management portal, which makes it easier for admins and other users to identify a user.
  
### Set up attributes for all users in the organization

- Select **Directory** \> **More** ![Screenshot of More icon.](media/more-icon.png), and then select **Change Attributes** from the drop-down menu. 
    
- To add a new attribute, select **Add New**, and then choose from a range of pre-defined suggested attributes or add a new one. 
    
    ![Change attributes on Kaizala users, like name, phone number and job title.](media/661ce7d7-0ef7-4c40-a850-31fa44aed4ee.png)
  
  - You can decide whether it's optional or mandatory for users to enter data for an item selected from the suggested attributes.
    
  - For a custom attribute, you can enter the name of the attribute, select its type (string, number, Yes/No, and date/time), and select whether it is mandatory or optional for users to enter data for it.
    
  - Once you've made changes to the attribute, select **+** to add it to the list, or **-** to remove it. 
    
  - You can add multiple attributes at once.
    
- Once you've finalized the list of attributes, select **Save** to add the new changes to the organization's attribute list. 
    
## Add users in bulk to your organization

If you want to add several users without using the comma-separated list, you can do so using **Bulk upload**. 
  
1. Select **Directory** \> **Add Users**, and then select **Import Multiple Users**. 
    
2. On the **Import Multiple Users** page, download the CSV template. [Add several users at the same time to Office 365 - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/1f5767ed-e717-4f24-969c-6ea9d412ca88#__toc316652088).
    
3. Follow the template to add your users and their phone numbers to Kaizala. Save the file in .csv format.
    
4. Choose **Select a File**, and then select the file you saved above. Finally, select **Upload**. 
    
    ![Bulk add users to Kaizala.](media/8f4f5b63-ae6e-4aac-959f-a9022612a058.png)
  
5. On the **Upload Users History** page, you can check the status of the uploaded file. Select **Refresh** to get the latest status. If the status is **Completed**, you can find the updated user list on the Users page. 
    
> [!NOTE]

2. Choose the phone number for that user to see a detailed view.

All data, including messages, Kaizala Actions and attachments for these groups will be deleted from their device. 
    
## Kaizala user roles

There are three different user roles in Kaizala. Here are the available roles and what people assigned to them can do.
  
| users.md | users.md |
|:-----|:-----|
|**Role** <br/> |**What they do in Office 365** <br/> |
|**Kaizala organization administrator** <br/> |Kaizala organization admin is a user who can manage Kaizala for your organization. The built-in Office 365 role,  *global admin* is an equivalent of the Kaizala organization admin. Office 365 global admins will have access and ability to manage all organization groups, even those they aren't direct members or admins of.  <br/> |
|**Kaizala group administrator** <br/> |Kaizala Group administrator is a Kaizala Group member with special privileges. Unlike an organization admin, they have to be an admin of the group they are handling to have said privileges. Group admins can perform all the actions a organization admin can, but only on the groups they are explicitly made an admin of.  <br/> |
|**Member** <br/> |A Kaizala user with no special privileges. They can only take part in 1:1 and group communication and view attributes of their own groups and conversations. They can't add or remove other members from the group.  <br/> |
