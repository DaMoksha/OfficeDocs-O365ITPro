Microsoft Kaizala is a secure chat and messaging app that enables mobile users to send instant messages, Kaizala Actions, and attachments such as pictures, documents, videos, audios and more. Microsoft Kaizala also lets you get instant feedback from your users about anything you want. Using Kaizala Actions, you can send out polls and surveys to any number of users (few or thousands). All received responses are automatically aggregated and presented in an easy-to-view report, which helps in decision making.
  
## Install Microsoft Kaizala on a mobile device

[Get Kaizala for your mobile phone.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=851074)
  
Microsoft Kaizala is supported on the following devices:
  
- Android phones running Android 4.3 or higher.

You'll need a wireless or data connection to the internet to use Microsoft Kaizala. Microsoft Kaizala doesn't support tablets that are Wi-Fi only.
  
## Verify your phone number

You must be able to receive phone calls and text messages on the phone number that you are trying to verify. A Microsoft Kaizala account can only be verified using one phone number, on one device. If you try to use Kaizala with the same phone number on multiple phones, you'll be logged out from all previous phones. Also, all Kaizala data on all previous devices will be deleted.
  
## Manage your profile and work account in Kaizala

Change your profile in the Kaizala app by going to the **Profile** page. You can change info like your picture, display name and your email address. You can also sign in with your Office 365 account or school account from **Profile**. When you do so, others Kaizala users in your organization will be able to see you and collaborate with you. You'll see an **Organization** page from where you can initiate a chat or create a group. 
  
## Find Contacts and Start chatting

Find your phonebook contacts using Kaizala, and initiate a 1:1 conversation with them.

  - Click or tap the contact's image to view their profile summary.

You can also quickly send an invite to any contact that's not using Kaizala. Click or tap **Invite**  to send a SMS to invite any such contact to install Kaizala. 
  
## Start a chat on the Kaizala mobile app

- Go to **Chats** \> **+** \> **Start a chat**

You can find all your recent conversations inside the **Chat** section, from where you can also start/resume a conversation.

## Use Kaizala Actions

You can send **Actions** by tapping the \<palette\> icon from the top right corner of a conversation. Built in Kaizala Actions help you coordinate frequently-used tasks for common workflow scenarios. You can find and use Kaizala Actions from the **Discover** page in the app. The available Kaizala Actions include: 
  
- **Announcement** - Use to make key announcements or share updates with your team. Announcements are a great way to share a message across groups in an organization or in a broadcast group. Engage with your audience about the announcement using likes and comments. 
    
- **Job** - Use to assign jobs to people and track their completion status through chat messages. The job creator and the assignee, can add quick comments to indicate the progress of the work. Other members of the group can also comment on the job and status. 
    
- **Let's Meet** - Use to send quick meeting invitations. The invitee can respond to the invite within the chat and confirm whether they can meet. 
    
- **Live Location** - Use to request for the location of a colleague or friend. Users get a choice to share their location with you for a specified duration of time. Location can be tracked in real-time. 
    
- **Photo with Location** - Use to share real-time photo information with others, along with the GPS coordinates which show where the photo was taken. For example, with a single tap, team members can share a geo-tagged picture with others. This can be used to confirm that a specific task has been completed at a specific location. It can also be used for location-based attendance. 
    
- **Share Location** - Use to share the location of your team members or phonebook contacts using Kaizala. This helps in coordinating with all team members. 
    
- **Quick Poll** - Use to design a custom poll to gather information from your team or from your customers. Respondents can then respond to the poll quickly and easily. Responses are updated in real-time and are presented in an easy-to-read way. You can also create poll questions with predefined responses. 
    
- **Request Location** - Use to request the current location of Kaizala users. This helps in areas of marking attendance, or tracking the presence of your team at any point in time.
    
- **Submit Bill** - Use to quickly capture the photo of an invoice and share it with details. 
    
- **Survey** - Use a poll and a survey in similar ways except for the following: 
    
  - In a poll, you can only ask one question. In a survey you can ask multiple questions. 
    
  - In a poll, you can only set the multiple choice format for a response. Conversely, in a survey, you can choose multiple formats for responses: multiple choice, text, numbers or even an image.
    
- **Checklist** - Use to share a list of tasks with a person or a group, and have them individually complete each task. 
    
  -  Create to-do lists and capture everyone's status.
