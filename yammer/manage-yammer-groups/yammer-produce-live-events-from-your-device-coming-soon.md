## What is new about Yammer live events?

Live events produced using Teams can now be scheduled and viewed in Yammer! This is one of the largest customer asks we have and we're excited to release this new functionality.

## Benefits

- Schedule live events directly within Yammer (takes less than 30 seconds end-to-end).
- Attendees can view a Teams produced event in Yammer (for all events scheduled from Yammer).
- Use Teams to produce your live eventâ€”without an external app or device!
- Get access to all the analytics available from Microsoft Stream.
- Question and Answer + regular Yammer events feed is available.
- All events are stored in Stream (and are searchable there, like any other live event).

For the full list of features, see [Overview of live events](yammer-live-events.md).

## FAQ

### How can I use Teams to produce an event in Yammer?

1. Schedule the event.

2. Share the event from Yammer.

3. When it's time to go live, produce/present from Teams as usual.

### What is the difference between this feature and what is available in GA today?

The main benefit of this feature is that all attendees can view a Teams-produced event in Yammer. We've worked with Teams and Stream to make this available for our Yammer customers. Now, event organizers can schedule their event in Yammer, produce it using Teams, but view it in Yammer.

A few things to note:

- Just like any live event: only admins in connected communities can create an event.

- With this flow, the event is still produced in Teams (producers/presenters must use Teams to produce/present).

- Analytics are available in Stream (rather than Teams).

- The event will not automatically be added to a producers/presenters' calendar at this time (under active investigation).

### Who can use this feature?

Only Yammer admins in connected communities.

### What kind of analytics do I get with this feature?

You get access to all the advanced analytics available via Stream.

![Screenshot showing live event analytics.](../media/yam-analytics.png)

Event producers can see the total number of watchers when the event is live. When the event is completed, the producer can see the total number of views across the lifetime of the video subject to the view count algorithm.

### Do I need a Stream and Teams license to use this feature?

Yes, both are required.

Yammer has partnered with both Teams and Stream to provide the best technology for running your live event. Because of this, creation and production of webinar style live events require Stream and Teams licenses and specific permissions. These permissions are not controlled in Yammer settings and a network admin will have to enable these permissions and they will have to be enabled for both Stream and Teams.

- **Stream**: For steps to grant or remove permissions in Stream, see [Administration controls for live events in Stream](/stream/live-event-administration).

- **Teams**: For requirements, see [Who can create and schedule live events in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/plan-for-teams-live-events). For steps to set policies, see [Set up for live events in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/set-up-for-teams-live-events).

### How many concurrent viewers can watch this event?

Currently, live events support up to 10,000 concurrent viewers. For more information, see [Microsoft Stream live event overview](/stream/live-event-overview).

### What is the maximum duration of an event?

Four (4) hours.

### Who can watch a live event?

- In a private community, only users who are part of the event can view the event.
- In a public community, attendees who are part of the community and any other tenant community members who come to the event page can view the event.
