# Deprecation of Basic/Fremium Networks

We will be deprecating Yammer Basic/Freemium networks by the end of 2022 for smoother integration and bringing exciting new functionality to our customers.

**Q. We still want a Yammer network. What can we do?**

**A.**  If your organization has an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 license, enterprise Yammer is included. See [Add Yammer basic domains to your Office 365 tenant](/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/add-basic-domains-to-office-365).

If your organization doesn't have a license, [subscriptions are available](
https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans?rtc=1) starting at $8 per user per month.

**Q. My organization has an enterprise Yammer network, but we have users from Freemium networks collaborating with us. Can they still join our network as guests after it's discontinued?**

**A.**  Not unless they upgrade their license too. If you're based in the US, you can invite them to collaborate with you through an [external network](/yammer/work-with-external-users/create-and-manage-an-external-network).

**Q. What if we want to keep all our data from the old network and move it to the new network?**

**A.**  Data migration isn't a service provided by Microsoft. You can [engage a partner](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=862345&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=US) for data migration service from your basic network to your new enterprise network.

**Q. I don't have an enterprise network provisioned yet. Can I just add my basic network domain to Office 365/Microsoft 365? Will that allow me to upgrade in place?**

**A.**   **NO.** Adding your basic network domain to Office 365/Microsoft 365 will delete the contents of your basic network. Export your basic network data first.

**Q. We are a nonprofit organization that relies on a free version of Yammer. What can we do?**

**A.**  Microsoft offers special pricing for legally registered nonprofit organizations around the world. Learn more about eligibility [here](https://www.microsoft.com/nonprofits/eligibility?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr4).

**Q. What if we just want to export our data from the basic network?**

**A.**  Please contact support to receive temporary administrator role access to your basic network in order to perform a full export of the network data.

**Q. What is the latest date we can upgrade and maintain access to our Basic/Freemium network data?**

**A.**  You will lose access to your old network on or before December 1, 2022. Data will be deleted 30 days after loss of access.
